        "details": "When your tires are rotated, the wheels are removed and replaced from front to back, right to left. When they are balanced, a mechanic uses a special machine to check to see if the weight of the tire and wheel is balanced.Do tires need to be balanced every time they are rotated?It's not completely necessary to balance tires when rotating, but it is a good idea to do so. When performed by a shop, the balancing procedure is inexpensive, so its usually paired with the rotation. If you're doing a rotation job yourself, it's up to you whether you want to also balance.On average, tires should be balanced and rotated at least once every six months. As the tires are the parts of your car that are exposed most to roads, they will invariably suffer the maximum wear and tear. However, through rotation and balancing, you can ensure that your car's tires last a long time."
